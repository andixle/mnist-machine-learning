# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This is a machine learning project I built for IndyHacks, where I placed 3rd place.  
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with about 98% accuracy.  

The project also includes a small Pygame whiteboard where you can draw a digit, and the model will predict it in real time.

## Features
- Train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset  
- Achieve ~98% accuracy on test data  
- Interactive **Pygame whiteboard** to draw digits and get predictions
